description: Delegate investigation, an explicit fix request, or follow-up rescue work to the Codex rescue subagent
argument-hint: "[--background|--wait] [--resume|--fresh] [--vendor <codex|grok|kimi>] [--model <model|spark>] [--effort <none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh>] [what the vendor should investigate, solve, or continue]"

Invoke the `catalyst:envoy-runner` subagent via the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: "catalyst:envoy-runner"`), forwarding the raw user request as the prompt.
`catalyst:envoy-runner` is a subagent, not a skill — do not call `Skill(catalyst:envoy-runner)` (no such skill) or `Skill(catalyst:rescue)` (that re-enters this command and hangs the session). The command runs inline so the `Agent` tool stays in scope; forked general-purpose subagents do not expose it.
The final user-visible response must be Codex's output verbatim.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the `catalyst:envoy-runner` subagent in the background.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the `catalyst:envoy-runner` subagent in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Do not forward them to `task`, and do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the forwarded `task` call, but do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- `--vendor <codex|grok|kimi>` is a runtime-selection flag too. Preserve it for the forwarded `task` call. Leave it unset unless the user explicitly asks to run the task through Grok or Kimi; kimi does not support `--effort`.
- If the request includes `--resume`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- If the request includes `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Codex, check for a resumable rescue thread from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/envoy/scripts/envoy-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Codex thread or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Codex thread`
  - `Start a new Codex thread`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before routing to the subagent.
- If the user chooses a new thread, add `--fresh` before routing to the subagent.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally.

Operating rules:

- The subagent is a thin forwarder only. It should use one `Bash` call to invoke `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/envoy/scripts/envoy-companion.mjs" task ...` and return that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the Codex companion stdout verbatim to the user.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not ask the subagent to inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/catalyst:envoy-status`, fetch `/catalyst:envoy-result`, call `/catalyst:envoy-cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a specific reasoning effort.
- Leave the model unset unless the user explicitly asks for one. If they ask for `spark`, map it to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`.
- Leave `--resume` and `--fresh` in the forwarded request. The subagent handles that routing when it builds the `task` command.
- If the helper reports that Codex is missing or unauthenticated, stop and tell the user to run `/catalyst:envoy-setup`.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what Codex should investigate or fix.
